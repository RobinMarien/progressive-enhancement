            <h2>The story</h2>

            <blockquote>Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away.
                That evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate.
                They said, <q class="neighbor">We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate.</q>
                The farmer said,<q class="farmer"><em>Maybe</em>.</q>
                The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening everybody came back and said,
                <q class="neighbor">Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!</q>
                The farmer again said, <q class="farmer"><em>Maybe</em>.</q>

                The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg.
                The neighbors then said, <q class="neighbor">Oh dear, that’s too <strong class="bad">bad</strong>,</q>
                and the farmer responded,<q class="farmer"><em>Maybe</em>.</q>
                The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army,
                and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg. Again all the neighbors came around and said,
                <q class="neighbor">Isn’t that great!</q>
                Again, he said, <q class="farmer"><em>Maybe</em>.</q>

                The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity,
                and it’s really impossible to tell whether anything
                that happens in it is or <strong class="bad">bad</strong> — because you never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune; or,
                you never know what will be the consequences of <strong class="good">good</strong> fortune.</blockquote>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p><strong class="good">Good</strong> and <strong class="bad">Bad</strong> are just one perspective. Bananas are <strong class="good">good</strong> for monkeys,
        but monkeys are not <strong class="good">good</strong> for bananas. Let's not make a big deal out of it...</p>
